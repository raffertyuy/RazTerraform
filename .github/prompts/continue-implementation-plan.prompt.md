Check the implementation plan as there are still steps that are not marked as complete.

- If you simply forgot to mark them as complete, do so.
- Otherwise, if you have not implemented the step, do so. Follow the [plan-implementation-guidelines](../prompt-snippets/plan-implementation-guidelines.md)

Continue iterating until all steps are complete.

**DO NOT FORGET** to update the plan and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
