Your task is to run `terraform plan` and then `terraform apply` on the example that you just implemented.
Validate the output and then fix any issues that arise during the process.

For any changes/fixes applied, document them in the implementation plan.
Once the implementation has been properly applied, DO NOT destroy it. Instead, let me know so I can check the deployment manually, and destroy it MANUALLY when I'm done.
