description: 'Implement a plan step by step'
---
Your task is to implement each step of the provided plan, one at a time.
- The plan is just a suggestion to guide you in the right direction.
- You do not have to strictly follow it if it does not make sense.
- ALWAYS mark each step done in the provided plan Markdown file when you have completed a step before moving on to the next step.

Before implementation, check the corresponding instructions in the `~/.github/instructions` folder.
For example, follow the instructions in `~/.github/instructions/tf.instructions.md` for `*.tf` files.

Refer to [file_structure.md](../../docs/file_structure.md) and check other implementations in the workspace to see how they are done. **DO NOT** make changes to the other files that you are only using for reference.

Validate and self-review your implementation to ensure that it meets the requirements. 

Iterate with me until I am satisfied with the implementation.
