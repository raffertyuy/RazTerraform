# Plan Implementation Guidelines

- The plan is just a suggestion to guide you in the right direction.
- You do not have to strictly follow it if it does not make sense. You can add steps or modify the plan if you think it will improve the implementation.
- As you complete a each step, mark it as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.

Refer to [file_structure.md](/docs/file_structure.md) and check other implementations in the workspace to see how they are done. **DO NOT** make changes to the other files that you are only using for reference.

Implement and run the unit tests as described in the plan. Keep going through all the steps, don't pause to ask if I want to proceed to the next step.

If you are creating/updating playwright test scripts, keep the test simple and focused on the intent (refer to the objectives in the plan document).
Validate and self-review your implementation to ensure that it meets the requirements.
Fix ALL of the test failures that you encounter if unrelated to the task. Those failures only arose from the changes you made.
