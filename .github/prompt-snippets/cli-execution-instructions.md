When running commands, always do so from the root of the project directory and not within a subdirectory.

When running commands, be mindful of the operating system as the paths and environment variables may differ. Use relative paths when possible.

When running commands, be mindful if you are running something that is watching. Run commands as background processes as much as possible to avoid blocking the terminal. Check if if the existing terminal is ready to accept new commands first. Be mindful if the terminal is ready to accept commands or if a previous command is still running. Evaluate if you need to launch a new terminal.
